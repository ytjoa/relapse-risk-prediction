# Analysis and Prediction of the Likelihood of Relapse for Selected Addictive Substances Following Rehabilitation

- Substance abuse and drug-related deaths are increasing in the U.S., making rehabilitation a critical component of addiction treatment. However, the effectiveness of rehabilitation in preventing relapse remains a key concern.

- This project aims to analyze data on individuals who have undergone rehabilitation, explore the relationship between substance use and treatment, and develop models to predict the likelihood of relapse. Understanding these patterns will help improve intervention strategies and treatment outcomes.
